h1. Matrix Tidy Cols

EE1 extension that cleans up your Matrix field-column associations after duplicating a site with MSM.

h3. Installation

To install Matrix Tidy Cols, upload ext.matrix_tidy_cols.php to your system/extensions/ folder.

h3. Usage

Whenever you duplicate a site with MSM, make sure you go to Admin > Utilities > Extensions Manager, and click the “Enable” button beside Matrix Tidy Cols. The script will run, and you will be given a log of what happened. After returning to the Extensions Manager page, the Matrix Tidy Cols extension will still be disabled, because it doesn’t actually install any extension hooks. Don’t worry about it.
